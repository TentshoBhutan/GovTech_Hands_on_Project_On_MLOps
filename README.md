TODO:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>EDA and feature engineering</li>
  <li>Train ML model on the data (try simple models like logistic regression, SVM to more complex ones like random forest, XGBOOST and then compare their results with neutral networks)</li>
  <li>Monitor model training on Weights and Bias</li>
  <li>Setup CI/CD pipeline to automate training process with DVC for data and model file tracking. </li>
  <li>Select best model you get and build a flask/streamlit web application to make inference</li>
  <li>Containerize web application into Docker image</li>
</ol>
